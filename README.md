# [Project: VanArsdel Sales Overview - Using Power Bi]

**Power BI Project--Dashboard
  
  * https://app.powerbi.com/admin-portal/tenantSettings

**Preparation
  * 1, Download the latest PowerBI desktop https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/
  * 2, Make sure you have the PowerBI service account
  * 3, Consult your company IT before you download and install this gateway. https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/gateway/

**Overview
  * Various key features of the Power BI service. 
  * How to author reports using Power BI Desktop and create operational dashboards via the Power BI Service.

**Data Set
  * The dataset is a sales and market share analysis. 
  * This type of analysis is very common for the office of a Chief Marketing Officer (CMO). 
  * Unlike the office of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), a CMO is focused not only on company’s performance internally (how well do our products sell) but also externally (how well do we do against the competing products). 
  * The company, VanArsdel, manufactures expensive electronic products that could be used for fun as well as work and it sells them directly to consumers nationwide as well as several other countries. 
  * VanArsdel and its competitors have retained a 3rd party marketing company to collect and anonymize industry sales so that all participants can benchmark themselves.

**Description
  
  * Power BI – how Microsoft’s Power BI service can help bring your data to life with rich visualizations and analytic capabilities in this project, we will work through hands-on labs to explore the components of Power BI, from data ingestion and modelling, report creation, and publishing. 

**Outline

  * 1.Introduction: 
    *	What is Power BI 
    *	What can we do with it, and make sure is setup. 
    *	Then we’ll go into the desktop and web portal to navigating around the menus and how to get started with a visualization!
  2.	Data Ingestion: 
  •	Power BI Desktop Query Editor used to ingest data from various data sources. 
  •	Power BI supports over 60 native data connectors! 
  •	We won’t use them all, but we can ingest data from multiple disparate sources and combine them into a single data model.
  3.	Data Shaping and Modelling: 
  •	Query Editor used to perform data transformations (called “shaping”) on the data. 
  •	Once loaded into the data model, 
    additional calculations can be added, 
    and the attribute names, 
    relationships and structure of the model can be optimized for ease of use.
  4.	Report Design and Creation: 
  •	Power BI Desktop used to create visualizations and reports based on our data model. 
  •	Power BI natively supports 30+ chart types, 
  •	Power BI also has a gallery of 60+ more custom visualizations created by the Power BI developer community. 
  •	How to configure and format visualizations and how to get your visualizations to interact with each other for deeper analytic insights.
  5.	Publishing Reports and Creating Dashboards: 
  •	Once the Report is created, it is time to publish our content to the Power BI service. 
  •	Power BI is a SaaS model, so reports can be published and viewed by members of your organization. 
  •	We will create Dashboards from our Report, 
  •	Power BI’s Q&A functionality allows user to ask natural language questions of their data. 
  •	How to schedule data refreshes and integration with Microsoft’s personal digital assistant Cortana.
  6.	Sharing and Collaboration: 
  •	The real power of Power BI is being able to share the data, reports, and insights you have gained with others in your organization. 
  •	The various ways to share your content and how security is configured to allow only authorized users to see the data they are authorized to see.
  7.	Advanced Analytics and Use your own data: 
  •	How to embed advanced analytics into your Power BI dashboards. 
  •	Power BI supports running R scripts for analytics and creating visualizations. 
  •	If you brought your own data to explore, we will also use this time to explore how you can use Power BI with your own dataset to gain actionable insights.
  8.	Governance and Administration in Power BI (For IT/Tech only)

# [Project: Clustering Observations -  Test & Control Market Selection] - Using Minitab 18, jmp, Python, and Excel.  

**DESCRIPTION:
  
  * We have 20 candidate markets that this company has a presence in.
  * The best practice to conduct some tests or experiments, and it is an excellent principle to conduct experiments to define one market as a test market in the sense that he will get some treatment or some marketing incentives.
  * Then, choose another market as a control market similar to the test market with different characteristics, so that when the results come from tests or experiment, it is a little easier to attribute the effect or impact of what the test market receives compared to what the control market receives.
  * We have 20 candidate markets, and we have nine variables measured across these 20 markets.

# [Project: Statistical Inference-ONLINE MORTGAGE APPLICATION_DATA] - Using Minitab 18, jmp, Python, and Excel.

**DESCRIPTION:

 * We estimated characteristics of the population of applications based upon a sample of applicants completing a new prototype of an online application process. 
 * After further exploration of the applicants using the test, it was identified that they differed in their level of knowledge / experience.

 * As a result, each applicant was rated as having a low level of knowledge / experience, medium or high.
 * Estimation across confidence intervals the average completion time of a set of requests from each of the three types of experience (low, medium, and high).
 * Some elements of uncertainty in the findings and conclusions.
