# [Project: Potential Locations for Retirement Housing Community] - Using Minitab 18, jmp, and Excel.  

**DESCRIPTION
  * The top focus for Horizon View Properties is to become the premier retirement housing community in the country and provide the affluent segment of the baby-boomer retirees with an exceptional lifestyle. 

**OBJECTIVES:
  * Group similar geographic areas by housing affordability,  cultural and social amenities, and health care
  * Create a brand name for each group category
  * Score/Rank each group
**STRATEGIES
  * Search for appropriate datasets.
  * Perform data analysis.
  * Create a scoring system.
  * Create data visualization.
  * Conclusion and Recommendation

**Primary Analysis based on six (6) identified variables for each of the 120 cities.   
  * Data Variables 
  * Cost of Living
  * Healthcare
  * Climate
  * Population over 45 years old
  * Well-being
  * Public Safety
 
**The results are each city’s scores in the following indexes (Higher is better):

# [Project: Clustering Observations -  Test & Control Market Selection] - Using Minitab 18, jmp, and Excel.  

**DESCRIPTION:
  * We will identify cities that can serve as a test and control of market pairs, for example, in an experiment.
  * We have 20 candidate markets that this company has a presence in.
  * The best practice to conduct some tests or experiments, and it is an excellent principle to conduct experiments to define one market as a test market in the sense that he will get some treatment or some marketing incentives.
  * Then, choose another market as a control market similar to the test market with different characteristics, so that when the results come from tests or experiment, it is a little easier to attribute the effect or impact of what the test market receives compared to what the control market receives.
  * We have 20 candidate markets, and we have nine variables measured across these 20 markets.

**OBJECTIVES:


**STRATEGIES:
 * Examine the relationships (correlation) between the variables.
 * Perform a Cluster Observations Analysis (Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm).
 * Cluster Analysis of ObservationsThe table of Amalgamation Steps.
 * Cluster Analysis of ObservationsThe table of Final Partition.
 * Cluster Analysis of ObservationsThe table of Cluster Centroids.
 * Examine the Cluster Solution across the nine variables via Scatter Plots.
**Primary Analysis:
